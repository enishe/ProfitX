# ProfitX — Database Setup

## Neon connection

ProfitX uses the Neon PostgreSQL database named `profitx`.

In `backend/.env`, configure `DATABASE_URL` with the pooled Neon URL and `DIRECT_URL` with the direct URL used by Prisma migrations. Keep `backend/.env` local and do not commit it.

## Prisma setup

Run from the repository root:

```powershell
cd backend
npm install
npx prisma validate
npm run db:check
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate status
```

Prisma reads the migration URL from `DIRECT_URL` in `prisma.config.ts`. The initial migration is stored under `backend/prisma/migrations/`.

## Seed demo data

After configuring `backend/.env` and applying the database migration, run from `backend/`:

```powershell
npm run db:seed
```

The command creates or updates a demo account (`demo@profitx.local`), two categories, two clients, and two suppliers. The demo account password is `ProfitXDemo123!`; change it before using the account outside local testing. The seed uses unique keys to safely run more than once without duplicating records.

To verify the rows in Neon's SQL Editor, select database `profitx` and run:

```sql
SELECT 'User' AS table_name, COUNT(*) AS rows
FROM "User"
WHERE email = 'demo@profitx.local'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Category', COUNT(*)
FROM "Category" c
JOIN "User" u ON u.id = c."userId"
WHERE u.email = 'demo@profitx.local'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Client', COUNT(*)
FROM "Client" c
JOIN "User" u ON u.id = c."userId"
WHERE u.email = 'demo@profitx.local'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Supplier', COUNT(*)
FROM "Supplier" s
JOIN "User" u ON u.id = s."userId"
WHERE u.email = 'demo@profitx.local';
```

The expected counts are 1 user, 2 categories, 2 clients, and 2 suppliers. Run the query before and after a second `npm run db:seed` invocation to confirm counts remain the same.

## Verify the tables in Neon

In Neon SQL Editor, select database `profitx` and run:

```sql
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY table_name;
```

The initial schema includes `User`, `Client`, `Supplier`, `Category`, `Transaction`, `Invoice`, and `InvoiceItem`, plus Prisma's `_prisma_migrations` table.
