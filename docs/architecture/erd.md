## Enums

- `TransactionType`: `INCOME`, `EXPENSE`.
- `CategoryType`: `INCOME`, `EXPENSE`.
- `InvoiceStatus`: `DRAFT`, `SENT`, `PAID`, `OVERDUE`, `CANCELLED`.

## Relationships and delete behavior

- `Client`, `Supplier`, `Category`, `Transaction`, and `Invoice` belong to one user. Deleting a user cascades to those owned records.
- A transaction must have one category. Deleting a category referenced by transactions is restricted.
- A transaction may reference a client or supplier. Deleting either sets the transaction's optional reference to `NULL`.
- An invoice belongs to one client. Deleting a client with invoices is restricted so invoice history remains valid.
- An invoice item belongs to one invoice. Deleting an invoice cascades to its items.
- The application should associate an income transaction with a client and an expense transaction with a supplier.
- `passwordHash` stores a password hash, never a plain-text password.
- An invoice item's line total is calculated as `quantity × unitPrice`; it is not stored separately.
- Financial reports should count transactions as income or expenses. An invoice alone is not a recorded payment.

## Indexes in `schema.prisma`

- `User.email` has a unique index for login and duplicate prevention.
- `Client` and `Supplier` have unique compound indexes on `(userId, email)` and regular indexes on `(userId, name)`. These support per-user email checks and user-scoped name listing. Their leading `userId` columns also support user-scoped lookups.
- `Category` has a unique compound index on `(userId, name, type)`.
- `Transaction` has indexes on `(userId, occurredAt)` and `categoryId`.
- `Invoice` has a unique compound index on `(userId, invoiceNumber)` and an index on `(clientId, issueDate)`.
- `InvoiceItem` has an index on `invoiceId`.

The compound indexes beginning with `userId` also serve queries filtering by `userId`; separate single-column indexes would duplicate those index prefixes.
